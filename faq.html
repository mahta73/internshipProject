        <p class='faq__question'>What is Girls Who Code HQ?</p>
        <p class='faq__answer'>
            Girls Who Code HQ is the official platform for all Girls Who Code programs!

            Girls Who Code HQ (generally just called "HQ") is where we provide resources to our members, including our
            unique curriculum, coding activities, and more.

            On the first day of Club programming, all students and Facilitators will need to sign up for HQ using their
            Club's unique Club Code.

        <p class='faq__question'>How do I sign up for HQ as a member?</p>
        <p class='faq__answer'>
            HQ is the Girls Who Code (GWC) learning platform where we provide all resources and free activities, so it
            is important to register when you join your Club.

            As a student, you will sign up for Girls Who Code HQ using an email address and your Club's unique Club
            Code. You will receive your Club Code from your Facilitator at the first Club meeting. If you are a student
            under 13, you will also need to provide a parent's email address to sign up.

            If you are missing your Club Code, please talk to your Facilitator.

            If you are having issues with registering, please reach out to us at clubs@girlswhocode.com.

            If you are not yet a member of Girls Who Code, you can either find a Club near you, or learn how to start
            your own!

        <p class='faq__question'>What is a Girls Who Code Club?</p>
        <p class='faq__answer'>
            Girls Who Code (GWC) Clubs are free extracurricular programs for 3rd-5th and 6th-12th grade girls that teach
            participants about Computer Science (CS) in a fun and safe environment!

            GWC Clubs take place throughout the academic year. They serve as a place for girls to spend time together
            while learning about CS and building their confidence.

            Clubs provide participants with a sisterhood of supportive peers and role models, and an opportunity to use
            their skills to positively impact their community.

            Clubs are hosted at non-profit locations, such as schools, libraries, and community centers. They are led by
            volunteer Facilitators, who use the curriculum and resources provided by GWC on our learning platform, HQ.
